# Global-Warming-Data
Data visualization in Python that uses list comprehension to create charts measuring average global temperature between certain time periods.

1a. Converts the data from scaled change in Celsius to absolute temperature in Fahrenheit.
1b. Calculates mean temperature in Fahrenheit over the entire data set.

2a. Finds the mean average temperature of each month.
2b. Finds lowest and highest average temperatures for each month.
2c. Finds when the lowest and highest temp occurred for each month.

3a. Function that takes a month, a starting year, and an ending year as input and outputs a list of that month's temperatures during the specified range.
3b. Function that takes the index of 2 years as input and outputs a list of the years in between.

4. Creates plots of the monthly average temperature over time for each month.

5. Creates a plot that shows the average annual temperature over all years.

6. Creates a plot showing the monthly average temperature starting in January 2000.

7. Plots the annual average temperature from 2000-2017.

8. Creates a plot of the monthly average temperatures starting in January 1990 and ending in December 1999.

9. Plots the annual average temperature of every year from 1990 to 1999.

10. Plots the monthly average temperature of every month in the 1890s.

11a. Creates plots of the monthly averages for the first 45 years.
11b. Creates plots of the monthly averages for the second 45 years.
11c. Creates plots of the monthly averages for the last 47 years.
